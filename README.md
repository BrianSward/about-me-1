## Reflections and Comments

Just a note to the odd passerby reading, for someone not at Code Fellows:

As this page is being built, there will be a number of non-standard approaches to code for the sake of demonstrating specific language syntax, structure, and function.  As this course develops, I expect to refactor this code many times.
