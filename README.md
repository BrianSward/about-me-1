# about-me

An autobiography created for Code Fellows aligned to a course curriculum. Work in Progress.

Author: Stephen Montague

## lab-class-03

- Add content to extend the previous guessing game  
- Get points for correct answers and display total points at the end of all games
- Practice in JS array objects and looping syntax

### Reflections and Comments

It wasn't required, but I used a loop and a scoring system on the last lab since it seemed natural (I didn't look ahead to this lab then), so it shouldn't be too difficult to adapt the current code to the new requirement of adding 2 more guessing games and a score.

### Reflections and Comments

Just a note to the odd passerby reading, for someone not at Code Fellows:

As this page is being built, there will be a number of non-standard approaches to code for the sake of demonstrating specific language syntax, structure, and function.  As this course develops, I expect to refactor this code many times.
