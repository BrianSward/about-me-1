      <h1>About Me</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <p>I'm a software developer currently studying at Code Fellows, as well as a game developer, graduate student in CS at Lewis University, and a married lucky father to two young daughters who're full of life and love. </p>
      <p> I have about 7 years of professional experience, ranging from remote supervisory administrative to face-to-face customer service and physical labor. Keeping on point  and keeping good relations are both very important to me.  I work well with others from varied backgrounds, and I love to use code to solve problems. </p>
